DEBUGGING:
* check why NPY_SORT_BASE+1 is needed for temp (valgrind?)
* fix float16 to int16 cast issues when XOR'ing
* fix all floats (currently not sorting)
IDEAS:
* extend stats to handle different dtypes
* re-bench SWAPN via conditional moves
* not only powers of 2 - also some additional in betweens
* block-deactivate comparators (reordering should help)
* do we use reordered batchers in the numpy right now?
* fix OVERLAP by copying up-front instead of falling back to insertion sort
PROBABLY NOT:
* replace min max cmpexchange for avx512_bitonic by our exchange?
* replace bitonic sorting network by optimal 16 inputs?
* take all optimal until 16 or so - lots of the speedup for little code size
