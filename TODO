DEBUGGING:
* check why NPY_SORT_BASE+1 is needed for temp (valgrind?)
BENCHMARKING:
* benchmark floats!
* re-benchmark ints with more reps
IDEAS:
* use assembler (via builtin/intrinsic functions?)
* find better way of swapping float128 and other floats via MMX registers?
* not only powers of 2 - also some additional in betweens
* block-deactivate comparators (reordering should help)
* do we use reordered batchers in the numpy right now?
PROBABLY NOT:
* replace bitonic sorting network by optimal 16 inputs?
* take all optimal until 16 or so - lots of the speedup for little code size
