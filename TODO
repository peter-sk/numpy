* replace 16 inputs avx512_bitonic by optimal network
* re-bench SWAPN via conditional moves
* pad with MAX_INTs/MIN_INTs/0s/+INF/-INF (use static max-256 array for this)
* not only powers of 2 - also some additional in betweens
* block-deactivate comparators
* do we use reordered batchers in the numpy right now?
DEBUGGING:
* test sorted for avx512_bitonic
* check why NPY_SORT_BASE+1 is needed for temp (valgrind?)
* fix OVERLAP by copying up-front OR avoiding totally via insertion sort at the end (CURRENTLY DONE!)
* fix float16 to int16 cast issues when XOR'ing
* fix all floats (currently not sorting)
PROBABLY NOT:
* replace min max cmpexchange by our exchange?
* replace bitonic sorting network by our networks?
