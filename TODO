DEBUGGING:
* check why NPY_SORT_BASE+1 is needed for temp (valgrind?)
* fix float128 for SWAP_TYPE == 4: ./bench.py fns_overlap 4 10 float128 1 1
BENCHMARKING:
* integrate SWAP_TYPE (maybe more smartly than now?)
* re-bench SWAPN via conditional moves
IDEAS:
* not only powers of 2 - also some additional in betweens
* block-deactivate comparators (reordering should help)
* do we use reordered batchers in the numpy right now?
PROBABLY NOT:
* replace min max cmpexchange for avx512_bitonic by our exchange?
* replace bitonic sorting network by optimal 16 inputs?
* take all optimal until 16 or so - lots of the speedup for little code size
